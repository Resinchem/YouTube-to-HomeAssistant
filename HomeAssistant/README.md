## Sample Home Assistant Files
Thees are sample files that you may use as a starting point for your particular needs.  You will likely need to modify these files to both match your environment and to specify the particular automation and notification actions you wish to execute when receiving a YouTube channel update.  The YAML files are provided here for reference, but many of these entities, such as helpers (input_number) and automations can be created via the Home Assistant UI instead of manually editing YAML files.
